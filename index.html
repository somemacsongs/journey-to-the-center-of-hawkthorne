        <!-- <p>Welcome, Community fans! This is a game designed to mesure your in-depth knowledge of my (and possibly yours too) favorite TV show, Community! (created by Dan Harmon)</p>
        <p>The game has three stages, each more difficult than the previous one. First, you will be tested on your general knowledge of the show, this one should be easy! Secondly, we will see if you really know what you're talking about... you can expect questions about the plots and sub-plots of your favorite episodes. Last but not least, on stage 3, we want to see how good your reference game is. It's meta! Abed gets it.</p>       
        <p>Every correct answer will grant you:</p>   
        <ul>
            <li>1 point for stage 1</li>
            <li>2 points for stage 2</li>
            <li>3 points for stage 3</li>
        </ul>      
        <p>All stages will have 10 questions each. At the end, your score will be revised and you will classified in 5 different levels of proficiency:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Level 1 - Human Being (0-15 points)</li>
            <li>Level 2 - Delta Cube (16-25 points)</li>
            <li>Level 3 - Ass Crack Bandit (26-35 points)</li>
            <li>Level 4 - Chicken Fingers Master (36-45 points)</li>
